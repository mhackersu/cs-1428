### Boolean
```
bool perfect
```
###### An offical type of something.
- true
- false
```
bool perfect = true;
```

### Math Operators
- Less Than
- Greater Than
- Equal
- Not-Equal
- Equal-To or Less-Than
- Equal-To or Greater-Than

```
Equal - A == B
Not-Equal A != B
Equal-To or Less-Than <=
Equal-To or Greater-Than >=
```

_The result is boolean.

### If Statements

```
grade = 
If (80<=grade<90)
    cout << "Your grade is.";
```

Example of order of operations (right to left):
```
int x = 1+2*3;
```

```
If (80<=grade)
```
- This would output a true or false

Therefore
```
(80<=grade)<90
```
- This would fail because the expression would essentially be saying is true or false less than 90. Therefore we have to use some LOGICAL OPERATORS:

```
AND - &&
OR - ||
NOT - !
```
