### Boolean
```
bool perfect
```
###### An offical type of something.
- true
- false
```
bool perfect = true;
```

### Math Operators
- Less Than
- Greater Than
- Equal
- Not-Equal
- Equal-To or Less-Than
- Equal-To or Greater-Than

```
Equal - A == B
Not-Equal A != B
Equal-To or Less-Than <=
Equal-To or Greater-Than >=
```

_The result is boolean.

### If Statements

```
grade = 
If (80<=grade<90)
    cout << "Your grade is.";
```

Example of order of operations (right to left):
```
int x = 1+2*3;
```

```
If (80<=grade)
```
- This would output a true or false

Therefore
```
(80<=grade)<90
```
- This would fail because the expression would essentially be saying is true or false less than 90. Therefore we have to use some LOGICAL OPERATORS:

```
AND - &&
OR - ||
NOT - !
```

|And| T | F |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | F |
| F | F | F |

####### Inclusive versus Exclusive

|Or | T | F |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | T |
| F | T | F |

### How would we validate the data going into the program?

int grade =
If ( (input < 0 ) && (input > 100) );
    cout << "Bogus Grade";

int grade =
If ( (grade => 0) || (grade =< 100) );
    cout << "Valid Grade";

### If Else Statements

- This method works but is not ideal:
```
bool perfect;
int grade = ;

If (grade == 100)
    perfect = true;
else
    perfect = false;
```
- Why? Because the expression to evaluate to two differient outputs and uses more memory.
- Another way of writing this could be the following:
```
bool perfect;
int grade = ;
perfect = grade == 100;
```
- Now we are storing the logical output of the boolean expression into the integer perfect.
