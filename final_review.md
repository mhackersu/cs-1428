### Charles (Rick) King

###### Boolean Expressions

-   Construct
-   Evaluate

###### If Statements

-   Review Starfleet Program

###### Augmented Assignment and Increment/Decrement Operators

-   Review 2nd Test (+=, ++, etc.)

###### Loops

-   Pretest vs Posttest
-   Construct
-   Trace

###### Flowcharts

-   4 Basic Constructs (If, If/Else, Pretest, Posttest)
-   Construct
-   Translate into code

###### Functions (Large % of Test)

-   Given a function, write a call.
-   Arguments - right number, order, type, units, value vs reference
-   Write a complete function w/ Prototype & call
-   Scope - Usage of a variable or parameter - where is it definded?
-   Scope - A definition of a variable or parameter - where does it have scope?

###### Files - the 6 parts (Write a complete program that writes your name to a file)

-   Include File
-   Variable
-   Open
-   Test that is open
-   Extract
-   Insert
-   Close

###### Arrays

-   Declaring vs using
-   Multi-dimensional arrays

###### Structs

-   Rick's silly onion metaphor
-   Navigate thru
-   Type of result

### Question 1 - 10 Points

-   Match up, code samples and flowcharts - 1 point each

### Question 2 (Multiple Choice T/F) - 6 Points

-   Various topics, functions, scope, structs - 1 point each

### Question 3 (Repeat of loop question on test 2) - 8 points

-   Various loops, what is the final value. - 1 point each

### Question 4 - 6 (Construct a call to the function) - 15 points

-   Select the function call from multiple choice. - 5 points each

### Question 7 (Onion question) - 20 points

-   Definitions (multiple structs, variables, arrays of variables, nested structures)
-   Chart with three columns (choose the code & type) - 2 points each
-   Exactly like the exercise in class.

### Question 8 - 10 points

-   If statements, loop, etc. (Fill in the missing part)

### Question 9 - (Scope) - 18 points

-   Multiple functions, multiple variables, local, global, etc.
-   Chart (Fill in the missing parts) - 1 point each
-   Determine the value at some point, Identify a specific definition of a variable, etc. (eg. List the functions where it can be used)

### Question 10 - (Coding Question) - Similar to #8 - 13 points

-   Describe something that you want to have happen.
-   Provide some code or fill in the missing pieces.
