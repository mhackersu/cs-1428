# Why C ++ (CPP)

Some people are calling CPP a dead language. Is this true?

According to the Tiobe Index, C/C++ is rated at approximatly 22.5% of all languages making it at the number one position. The last release of C/C++ was in 2017 with an expected release in 2020.

C with objects, otherwise known as C++, or otherwise known as increment C.

_Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.[12]
In 1983, "C with Classes" was renamed to "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C)_ - Wikipedia

_C++ is open-source and is built for performance. Aside from assembly level, C/C++ is about as fast as it gets._

In this class we will be looking for patterns in problem solving. Bottom up, top down and looking for generalities.

In our robot code, we are able to decrease the amount of code by breaking the problem into layers.

Questions we might ask ourself.

-   How do I go around this generic object?
-   What are the generic objects?

### The key is abstraction, but this abstraction has to be sustainable.
