## Chapter 1

### Algorithm

-   A set of well-defined steps to perform a task or to solve a problem

-   _Order is important_

### From a high-level program to an executable file

-   create a file containing the program with a text editor:
    -   program statements: source code
    -   file: source code
-   Run the _preprocessor_ to convert the source file directives to source code program statements.
-   Run the _compiler_ to convert source program statements into machine instructions (machine code), which is stored into an object file.

### From a high-level program to an executable file:

-   Source code
-   Preprocessor
-   Modified source code
-   Compiler
-   Object code
-   Linker
-   Executable code

### What is a program made of?

#### There are common elements in most programming languages:

##### Language Elements:

-   Key Words
-   Programmer-defined identifiers
-   Operators
-   Punctuation
-   Syntax

### Example C++ Program

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

```
int main() // main function that is invoked is called main
{
    double num1 = 5, num2, sum;
    num2 = 12;

    sum = num1 + num2;
    cout << "The sum is " << sum;
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Words

-   Also known as reserved words
-   Have a special meaning in C++
-   Can not be used for another purpose
-   Examples include:

    `using, int, double, return`

### Program Identifiers

-   Named made up by the programmer
-   Not part of the C++ language
-   Used to represent various things such as variables
-   Examples include:

    `double, num1`

### Operators

-   Used to perform operations on data
-   Many types of operators
-   Arithmetic: (+,-,\*,/)
-   Assignment: (=)
-   Examples include:

    `num2 = 12; sum = num1 + num2;`

### Punctuation

#### In a source file,

-   A line is all of the characters entered before a carriage return.
-   Blank lines improve the readability of a program.

### Variables

-   A variable is a

## 1.5 Input, Processing and Output

### Three steps that many programs perform

#### 1) Gather input data

-   from keyboard or mouse
-   from files on disk drives

#### 2) Process the input data

#### 3) Output the results of the processing

-   send it to the screen or a printer
-   write it to a file

## 1.6 The Programming Process

### 1) Define what the program is to do.

### 2) Visualize the program running on the computer.

### 3) Use design tools to create a model of the program.

-   Hierarchy charts, flowcharts, pseudocode, etc.

### 4) Check the model for logical errors.

### 5) Write the program source code.

### 6) Compile the source code.

### 7) Correct any errors during compilation.

### 8) Link the program to create an executable file.

### 9) Run the program using test data for input.

### 10) Correct any errors found while running the program.

### 11) Validate the results of the program.

-   Does the program do what was defined in step 1?
